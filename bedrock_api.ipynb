      "While moderate inflation is generally viewed as acceptable by economists, periods of high inflation can severely undermine a nation's economic growth and prosperity. When prices rise at an excessive rate, it distorts spending and investment patterns, erodes consumer purchasing power, and forces painful interventions by central banks to regain control over escalating costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "At its core, high inflation acts as a drag on real GDP growth by diminishing the value of money and discouraging investment. As prices spiral upward, consumers are forced to spend more on the same basket of goods and services, leaving them with less discretionary income to spend or invest elsewhere. This pullback in consumer demand can cause businesses to scale back operations and capital expenditures.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the supply side, high inflation increases input costs for companies across materials, labor, energy, and borrowing expenses. These higher costs of production often need to be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices, which can price some consumers out of the market altogether. The combination of weaker demand and supply-side constraints puts downward pressure on real GDP output.\n",
      "\n",
      "Critically, if inflation becomes entrenched in public expectations, it can lead to a self-perpetuating cycle of wage and price hikes that is difficult to arrest. Workers demand higher wages to maintain purchasing power, which feeds into higher production costs and prices for businesses. The longer this wage-price spiral continues, the more damaging it becomes for economic growth and productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "To combat high inflation, central banks typically need to raise interest rates aggressively, making borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers. While this can help cool demand-driven inflation pressures, it also increases the risk of tipping the economy into a recession as higher rates depress business investment and big-ticket household purchases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond these economic impacts, high inflation can also lead to negative social consequences by eroding living standards, increasing income inequality, and undermining faith in national currencies and institutions. Historically, episodes of extremely high or hyperinflation have caused severe economic dislocations and political instability.\n",
      "\n",
      "While some moderate inflation may be acceptable to account for a growing economy, policymakers must remain vigilant against letting price pressures become excessive and destabilizing. Preserving price stability is essential for fostering an environment conducive to sustainable economic growth, investment, and prosperity. Periods of high inflation can inflict severe damage on a nation's economic potential if allowed to become entrenched.\n",
